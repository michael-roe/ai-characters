<description>Abū Mūsā Jābir ibn Ḥayyān is a legendary figure in early Islamic science, traditionally believed to be an 8th-9th century alchemist who died circa 806-816. He is the purported author of an extensive Arabic corpus primarily focused on alchemy/chemistry, Shi'ite religious philosophy, and magic, but originally covering a vast range of topics like cosmology, medicine, and logic. His works, likely composed between 850-950, contain foundational contributions including the oldest known systematic classification of chemical substances, early instructions for synthesizing inorganic compounds like sal ammoniac from organic materials, and the influential sulfur-mercury theory of metals. The corpus also presents key Shi'ite doctrines and a unique quantitative philosophy ("science of the balance").</description>

<description>John Knill (1733–1811) was an English attorney who served as Collector of Customs at St Ives, Cornwall, from 1762 to 1782. Born in eastern Cornwall and trained in Penzance, Knill gained political influence through the Earl of Buckinghamshire and undertook a significant customs inspection mission in the West Indies. His career was marked by controversy due to his involvement in privateering during the Dutch and American wars. Knill is best remembered for his eccentric construction of Knill'amp;s Monument, a 50-foot triangular granite obelisk erected on Worvas Hill overlooking St Ives Bay around 1782. Knill'amp;s lasting legacy includes a trust fund established in his will for a distinctive quinquennial celebration in St Ives—featuring dances and processions—which continues to this day.</description>

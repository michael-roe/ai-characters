<description>Sir Godfrey Kneller (1646â€“1723) was the dominant portrait painter in England from the late 17th to early 18th century, renowned for his speed and skill. Arriving in England from Germany, his fame was secured when he outpaced Sir Peter Lely while painting King Charles II, earning royal favor. Knighted by William III in 1692 and later made a Baronet by George I, he painted ten successive British sovereigns, created the Hampton Court Beauties series, and produced the iconic Kit-cat Club portraits. Patronized by Charles II, James II, William III, and George I, Kneller commanded immense prestige and prolific output, establishing himself as the principal court artist after Lely's death. He was buried at his estate, Kneller Hall, and commemorated in Westminster Abbey.</description>

<description>For years, a mysterious and exquisitely beautiful woman occasionally attended services at Zennor Church, captivating the congregation with her enchanting singing and youthful appearance that never faded. She showed particular interest in Mathey Trewella, the parish's finest singer. One day, Mathey followed her and vanished forever; she too was never seen at the church again. The mystery was solved when a ship anchored near Pendower Cove was hailed by a mermaid. Rising from the sea, she pleaded with the captain to raise his anchor, explaining it blocked the door to her underwater home where her children waited, and revealed she was returning from Zennor Church. The terrified sailors complied and sailed away. Hearing this, the people of Zennor realized the mysterious lady was a mermaid who had lured Mathey Trewella to live with her beneath the waves, and they immortalized the event by carving her image (in her mermaid form) on a bench end in the church.</description>

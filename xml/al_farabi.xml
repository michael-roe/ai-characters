<description>Abū Naṣr Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Fārābī (c. 872 – 950/951 CE), known in Latin as Alpharabius, was a Persian polymath and one of the most significant Islamic philosophers of the medieval period, often called the "Second Master" after Aristotle. Born in Farab/Farayb, he traveled widely, studying and working in Baghdad (under scholars like Abū Bishr Mattā ibn Yūnus), Harran, Syria (Damascus), and possibly Egypt. Al-Fārābī authored groundbreaking treatises across numerous fields, including philosophy (particularly logic, political philosophy - where he is considered the "Founder of Islamic Political Philosophy", metaphysics, and ethics), music (his Kitāb al-mūsīqā al-kabīr), mathematics, physics, cosmology, logic, language, psychology, and medicine. A work on alchemy, Fī wujūb ṣināʿat al-kīmiyā (The Necessity of the Art of the Elixir), is attributed to him, though this attribution is disputed. He died in Damascus in 950 or early 951 CE.</description>

<description>According to local legend originating in St. Levan, Cornwall, Captain Wetherel drowned near the Rundle Stone after his ship sank, heroically refusing to abandon it and striking the ship'amp;s bell eight times as it went down. Ever since his burial in St. Levan Churchyard, a ghostly bell has been heard striking the hours and half-hours from within his altar-tomb, mimicking shipboard time. Multiple witnesses, including a skeptical sailor, attest to the phenomenon. However, the legend carries a warning: those who deliberately seek out the bell, like the sailor who soon died at sea afterward, invite terrible misfortune.</description>

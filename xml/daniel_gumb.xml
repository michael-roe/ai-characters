<description>Daniel Gumb was an 18th-century Cornish stonemason, mathematician, and self-taught astronomer known for his eccentric and solitary nature. Born into poverty around 1703 near Bodmin Moor, he displayed an early passion for learning, mastering Euclid and studying the stars with the mentorship of Plymouth scientist William Cookworthy. Rejecting conventional society, Gumb carved out a permanent home for himself and his wife Florence beneath a massive granite slab on the slopes of Carradon Hill. This unique dwelling, known ever since as Daniel Gumbâ€™s Rock, became a self-built shelter where they raised their family, living independently for decades amidst the moorland wilderness. Gumb continued his astronomical observations and mathematical studies within this rugged abode, leaving diagrams carved onto local rocks.</description>

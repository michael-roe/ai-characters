<description>Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (980-1037 AD) was a preeminent Persian polymath, mastering the Quran by age ten and excelling in philosophy, science, and medicine under tutor Natili in Bukhara. Driven by passion, he rapidly became a renowned physician, serving Prince Nuh ibn Mansur by age eighteen and composing significant early works. Though spending his life east of the Oxus and writing in Arabic, he endured political turmoil and imprisonments while serving various rulers, including as a vizier in Hamadan. Remarkably, amidst these tumultuous travels and personal excesses, he maintained prolific scholarly output, famously writing fifty pages daily. His enduring legacy includes monumental works like The Canon of Medicine and The Book of Healing, though his tomb's epitaph noted the irony that his philosophy didn't teach him to live well nor his medicine to live long.</description>
